# Scratchpads: hidden workspaces that slide over whatever you're on.
# Plain list, like session-vars.nix. One place for all of them:
#   - hyprland.nix writes it to ~/.config/hypr/arlo/scratchpads.lua, which
#     binds.lua (the keys) and rules.lua (the window rules) read
#   - quickshell.nix passes it to the bar (the tags and the chat menu)
#
# Fields:
#   name   the scratchpad, and its tag on the bar
#   key    normal ones: Super + key. Chat ones: Super + C, then key.
#   class  window class, as a regex that must match the whole class
#          (hyprctl clients shows it)
#   title  optional: window title regex, for apps with no usable class
#   cmd    how to start it; pressing the key starts it if it isn't running
#   size   optional: part of the screen it takes, 0.75 if left out
#   autostart  optional: start it hidden at login (chat apps always do)
#
# Chat apps (chat = true) also start hidden at login, sit behind the bar's
# chat menu instead of each getting a tag, and have their notifications
# collected there. `notify` matches their notifications' app name (regex,
# any case); `notifyBody` matches the text instead, for web apps, whose
# notifications all come from "Chromium" with the site on the first line.

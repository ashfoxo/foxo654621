# NixOS configuration for fox-red (formerly redfox)
# Astro blog + Miniflux + ntfy + MollySocket + Navidrome
# + Uptime Kuma + Forgejo, behind Caddy.
#
# All timers below are UTC. Local is EST/EDT, so subtract 5 or 4.
#
# Nightly order, deliberately non-overlapping:
#   01:00        postgres dump (HOST instance only, i.e. miniflux)
#   01:30-01:50  restic offsite backup, which first dumps Postgres and SQLite
#   02:10-02:25  music ingest: Filen -> beets -> Navidrome
#   03:00-05:00  autoUpgrade -- PAUSED for the rebuild, see Upgrades below
#   05:30        similar-songs check: Navidrome -> AudioMuse plugin
#   Sun 06:00    music stack update: Navidrome, AudioMuse, plugin together
#
# Secrets live encrypted in secrets/, one sops file per secret, readable only
# by the workstation's age key and fox-red's SSH host key (.sops.yaml). At
# activation sops-nix decrypts each one to /run/secrets/<name>, root:root
# 0400, and every service reads it from there. Edit one with:
#   sops --input-type binary --output-type binary secrets/<name>
#
# What each one holds:
#   storagebox-creds   username= / password= for the CIFS mount
#   miniflux.env       ADMIN_USERNAME= / ADMIN_PASSWORD=
#   molly.env          MollySocket registration
#   navidrome-api.env  ND_USER= / ND_PASSWORD= for an admin account. Used by
#                      music-ingest to trigger a library scan over the Subsonic
#                      API. Must be an admin: startScan is admin-only.
#   filen-rclone.env   RCLONE_CONFIG_FILEN_* defining the Filen rclone remote.
#                      PASSWORD and API_KEY are `rclone obscure` output, which
#                      is reversible encoding, not encryption. Treat as
#                      plaintext credentials. Re-export the API key via the
#                      Filen CLI if you ever change the account password.
#   navidrome.env      ND_PASSWORDENCRYPTIONKEY=. Must never change; a copy
#                      lives in Bitwarden.
#   health-check.env   KUMA_PUSH_URL= for the health-check push monitor
#   ntfy-alert.env     NTFY_URL= / NTFY_TOKEN=   (shell-sourceable)
#   kuma-push-url      full Uptime Kuma push URL, no query string
#   restic-password    long random passphrase, also kept off this box
#   restic-s3-env      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= for the
#                      bagger-red bucket
#   netbird-setup-key  one-time NetBird setup key. Only used for the first
#                      enrolment; after that it can expire harmlessly.
#   njalla-token       Njalla API token for the wildcard certificate. Limited
#                      to emberfox.net, _acme-challenge TXT records, the four
#                      record methods, and fox-red's own IPv4 and IPv6.
#   audiomuse.env      POSTGRES_PASSWORD= for AudioMuse's own database,
#                      AUDIOMUSE_USER= / AUDIOMUSE_PASSWORD= for its web login,
#                      API_TOKEN= for the Navidrome plugin and the nightly
#                      check, JWT_SECRET= so logins survive restarts, and
#                      NAVIDROME_USER= / NAVIDROME_PASSWORD= for the non-admin
#                      Navidrome account it reads the library through.
#   forgejo-runner.env TOKEN= the runner registration token from Forgejo's
#                      Site administration -> Actions -> Runners. Only used to
#                      register once; the runner keeps its own credentials.

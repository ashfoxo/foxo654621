# Single source of truth for colors. Plain attrset, like session-vars.nix.
#
# Usage in any module:
#   colors = (import ../../lib/palette.nix).for "fuzzel";
#   colors.forest   # -> "255C2B"
#
# Values are bare hex (no #). Each consumer adds whatever wrapper its format
# wants ("#255C2B" for CSS, "rgb(255C2B)" for hypr*, "255C2Bff" for fuzzel).
#
# Contrast notes (checked against WCAG):
#   - fg on forest / teal / rust: 6:1 or better, so the accents work as
#     *backgrounds* behind fg text (bar pills, selected items).
#   - forest / teal / rust on bg: 1.5-2.2:1. Too dark for text. Use them
#     for borders and fills only, never as text color on bg.
#   - The *_text colors and amber are the light versions for text and icons
#     on bg (6:1 or better).
